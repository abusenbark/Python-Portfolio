Tasks included:
>- Reviewing and changing data types
>- Building a data dictionary
>- Using subsets to create new dataframes
>- Finding and dealing with missing/duplicate values
>- Merging data frames and utilizing merge flags
>- If-statements, user-defined functions, for-loops, and loc() functions
>- Aggregating and grouping data
>- Creating visualizations

## In The Repository
Included in this repository are some of the scripts used during the final phase of the project showcasing the above techniques. The final summary report is also included.
